# Capsaicin Plot Tools for Matlab 

Capsaicin (CPS) Plot Tools simplify common plotting tasks, such as
adding reference lines or scaling all axes to a global minumum and
maximum. Some functions aim to provide an improvement over built-in
MatLab functions of the corresponding names. For example, compare
cpsFindFig with figure and cpsText with text.
 
Because all Capsaicin functions start with 'cps', typing 'cps' in
command window or editor followed by the tab-key lists the
functions. Provided, of course, that tab completion is enabled in
Matlab's preferences.
